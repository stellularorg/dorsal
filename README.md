# üê¨ dorsal

Dorsal is the backbone server structure of [Stellular projects](https://code.stellular.org/stellular)! It contains the base SQL helper modules and basic server helpers that make projects supporting `sqlite`, `mysql`, and `postgresql` easy to start and expand.

* Server crate located in `src/`
* Example/template project located in `dorsal_example/`

The Dorsal example also includes support for the user authentication base that is provided by [Guppy](https://code.stellular.org/stellular/guppy), however this is not required.

## Template Only

You can clone only the `dorsal_example/` directory with the command below:

```bash
PROJECT_NAME="dorsal_example" \
git clone -n --depth=1 --filter=tree:0 https://code.stellular.org/stellular/dorsal $PROJECT_NAME \
cd $PROJECT_NAME \
git sparse-checkout set --no-cone dorsal_example \
git checkout
```
